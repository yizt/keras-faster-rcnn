# ## Batch Slicing
# Some custom layers support a batch size of 1 only, and require a lot of work
# to support batches greater than 1. This function slices an input tensor
# across the batch dimension and feeds batches of size 1. Effectively,
# an easy way to support batches > 1 quickly with little code modification.
# In the long run, it's more efficient to modify the code to support large
# batches and getting rid of this function. Consider this a temporary solution
